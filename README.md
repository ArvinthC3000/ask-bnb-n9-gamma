## Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [Sematic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)
- [React Google Login](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-google-login)
- [Moment-Range](https://github.com/rotaready/moment-range)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
